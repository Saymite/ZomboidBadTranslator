# Badly Translated Zomboid Mod Generator

Welcome to the Badly Translated Zomboid Mod Generator!

This is the code I used to create a Badly Translated mod for a video and the Project Zomboid Steam Workshop.

**WARNING: RUNNING THIS WILL USE A BIG AMOUNT OF YOUR GOOGLE TRANSLATOR API CREDITS. THIS WAS ONLY CODED THIS WAY SINCE I HAD A BIG AMOUNT OF FREE CREDITS. PLEASE USE WITH CAUTION.**

## Features

- **Badly Translated Text**: Experience the game with hilariously mistranslated text that adds an extra layer of challenge and fun.
- **EXTREME Usage of Google Translator API**: Please be aware that running this code will consume a considerable amount of your Google Translator API credits. LAST WARNING.

## Usage

This is for local installation of the mod. You can easily adapt it to create a proper mod.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Set up your input and output folders in the Python file, as well as your key file.

   - **Key**: `key.json`
   - **Input**: `D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\ProjectZomboid\media\lua\shared\Translate\EN`
   - **Output**: `D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\ProjectZomboid\media\lua\shared\Translate\BT`

3. Launch Project Zomboid and enable the new language from the options menu.
